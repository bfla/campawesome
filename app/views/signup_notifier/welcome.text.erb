I'm Brian, founder and CEO of CampHero.  I'm writing to personally introduce myself and welcome you to CampHero.

I hope CampHero will make it easier for you to enjoy awesome camping.  If there's anything I can do for you, I am at your service.  I can be reached at this email address (brian@getcamphero.com).  I try to respond to all emails personally and as quickly as possible.  

Also, if you encounter any problems using CampHero or have suggestions for improvement, please let me know.  Although I can't incorporate all the feedback receive, I appreciate all feedback and take it seriously.

Happy camping, 
Brian
