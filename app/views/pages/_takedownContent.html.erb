<p><b>3. Counter-Notification</b></p>

<p>If the content provider, member or user believes that the material that was removed or to which access was disabled is either not infringing, or the content provider, member or user believes that it has the right to post and use such material from the copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent, or pursuant to the law, the content provider, member or user must send a counter-notice containing the following information to the Designated Agent listed below:</p>

<ol > <li>A physical or electronic signature of the content provider, member or user;</li>
<li>Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access to has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or disabled;</li>

<li>Content provider's, member's or user's name, address, telephone number, and, if available, e-mail address and a statement that such person or entity consents to the jurisdiction of the Federal Court for the judicial district in which the content provider's, member's or user's address is located, or if the content provider's, member's or user's address is located outside the United States, for any judicial district in which CampHero is located, and that such person or entity will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.</li>

<p>If a counter-notice is received by the Designated Agent, CampHero may send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that it may replace the removed material or cease disabling it in 10 business days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the content provider, member or user, the removed material may be replaced or access to it restored in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at CampHero's discretion.</p>
